# mousetracking (designed for Collector)
By Dr. Kristian Tempelmans Plat, Prasannajeet Mane and Dr. Anthony Haffey

Mousetracking is a default experiment available on collector (go to https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SKYIJF1dAjMDS6EHUIwfZm2KQVOzx17S6LbU_oSGxdE/edit?usp=sharing for information how to use Collector).

This repository includes trialtype code you can use "mousetracker.html" and the stimuli files you need to replicate the mousetracking experiment we ran (Haffey et al., under preparation).

This repository should be considered developmental
